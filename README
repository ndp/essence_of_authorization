Experimentation around Authorization, looking at CanCan and a few others... trying to figure
out the simplest thing that will work... without roles... just access to a resource by a user.


What these need:

model
=====
some mixins to your model so that you can grant and revoke privileges


controller
==========
ability to declaratively and programatically assert that current_user has a role
some testing strategy to make these efficient.

CanCan handles and exception thrown in the base controller, which seems to be nice solution.

other ones have the ability to require some access control has been defined explicitly



view -- view helpers
====================

  These are basically authorization checks that assume the "current_user".
